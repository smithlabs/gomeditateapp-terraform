![Rain](https://github.com/smithlabs/github-assets/raw/main/gif/rain.gif)

A meditation timer web app written in [Golang](https://golang.org/), [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/), and [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5). 

Deployed as a [Dockerized](https://www.docker.com/), clustered, [Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/) web application to [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/) using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

This folder contains the full [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) configuration that deploys the containerized web app across a cluster of web servers (using [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) and
[Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/) in an [Amazon Web Services (AWS) account](http://aws.amazon.com/).

## üî≠ Overview

This project will deploy the [gomeditateapp-docker](https://github.com/smithlabs/gomeditateapp-docker) project using the ``smithlabs/gomeditateapp:1.0`` container image from my [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/smithlabs/gomeditateapp). The following [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) resources are created.

- [Elastic Load Balancer](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) (Also known as the [Classic Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/introduction.html))
- [Auto Scaling groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/AutoScalingGroup.html)
- 2 x [EC2 instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) of [Amazon Linux 2](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/)
- [Security Groups for the Classic Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-security-groups.html)
- [Security Groups for the EC2 instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html)


üí° Below are links to the examples included in this repo.

- [Docker Build Example](https://github.com/smithlabs/gomeditateapp-terraform/tree/main/examples/dockerbuild) - Deploy the application by building the container from scratch using the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/smithlabs/gomeditateapp-docker/blob/main/Dockerfile).
- [Docker Hub Example](https://github.com/smithlabs/gomeditateapp-terraform/tree/main/examples/dockerhub) - Deploy the application by using the pre-built container from my [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/smithlabs/gomeditateapp). 

Note: The `main.tf` in the project root uses the Dockerhub container for the deploy.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Modules

`main.tf` utilizes my two custom Terraform modules. These modules should be pinned to `v1.0.0`.

| Name                                                                                                        | Version |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| [smithlabs/terraform-aws-asg-rolling-deploy](https://github.com/smithlabs/terraform-aws-asg-rolling-deploy) | v1.0.0  |
| [smithlabs/terraform-aws-elb](https://github.com/smithlabs/terraform-aws-elb)                               | v1.0.0  |

[Here](https://github.com/smithlabs/hello-world-terraform-go-demo/blob/main/main.tf#L12-L31) is where these modules are used in `main.tf`.

## üêæ Pre-requisites

- You must have [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) installed on your computer.
- You must have an [Amazon Web Services (AWS) account](http://aws.amazon.com/).
- (Optional) - [AWS CLI v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) is recommended if you want to deploy Terraform code using [multiple AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html).

Please note that this code was written for Terraform 0.13.x.

## üî¨ Requirements

| Name      | Version   |
| --------- | --------- |
| terraform | >= 0.13.0 |
| aws       | >= 2.35   |

## üêá Quickstart

**Please note that this example will deploy real resources into your AWS account. We have made every effort to ensure
all the resources qualify for the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/), but we are not responsible for any
charges you may incur.**

Configure your [AWS access
keys](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys) as
environment variables:

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=(your access key id)
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=(your secret access key)
```

Deploy the code:

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

When the `apply` command completes, it will output the DNS name of the load balancer. Visit the ELB url in your browser.

```
terraform output
```

Clean up when you're done:

```
terraform destroy
```
